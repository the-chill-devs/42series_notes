# 42series_notes

This is the first project that falls under the `42series` collection where `thechilldevs` create projects to learn and display their presence and contributions to Open Source Systems that they create for the purpose of community learning and skills development.

This specific project is a Notetaking mobile application. Developed using Golang (backend) and Expo Native (mobile), it is being created to learn the benefits of using monorepos and how Golang is efficient for backend systems. It also serves as a tutorial for introduction to Golang for Backend and API Development.
